Flash-Screen
============

``flash-screen`` makes the screen flash and emits a shutter sound. It
is intended to complement custom screenshotting scripts built around
_scrot, to provide visual feedback when a screenshot has been
triggered.

.. scrot_: https://github.com/resurrecting-open-source-projects/scrot

``flash-screen`` depends on GTK+ 3, GSound and pygobject.
